1,"\\text{Find the domain of } f(x) = \\frac{x+2}{x^2-4}","(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)","1) Set denominator ≠ 0: x^2 - 4 ≠ 0
2) Factor: (x+2)(x-2) ≠ 0
3) Solve: x ≠ -2 and x ≠ 2","Let's solve step-by-step:
1) Domain is all real numbers except where denominator = 0
2) Set denominator to zero: x^2 - 4 = 0
3) Factor: (x+2)(x-2) = 0
4) Solve: x = -2 or x = 2","Your solution is correct. To improve:
1) Explain why we set denominator ≠ 0
2) Show factoring clearly","Great work! To enhance:
1) Discuss domain concept
2) Explain restrictions"
2,"\\text{Simplify the expression: } \\frac{x^2-9}{x-3}","x + 3, x ≠ 3","1) Factor numerator: (x+3)(x-3)
2) Cancel common factor (x-3)
3) Result: x + 3
4) Restriction: x ≠ 3 (from original denominator)","Here's the step-by-step solution:
1) First, factor the numerator: x^2 - 9 = (x+3)(x-3)
2) Now we have: \\frac{(x+3)(x-3)}{x-3}
3) The (x-3) cancels out in numerator and denominator
4) We're left with: x + 3
5) But remember, x ≠ 3 because that would make original denominator zero
So, final answer: x + 3, where x ≠ 3","Your simplification is correct. To improve:
1) Always state the domain restriction
2) Explain why canceling is valid
3) Check your answer by substituting values","Excellent work! To enhance your explanation:
1) Discuss why we factor before simplifying
2) Explain the concept of 'holes' in rational functions
3) Show how to check your answer algebraically"
